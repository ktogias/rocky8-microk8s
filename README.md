# rocky8-microk8s

This is an [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) based GitOps project for setting up a [Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) cluster on nodes running [Rocky8](https://rockylinux.org/).

It is meant to be used for development, testing and learning purposes. It does not provide storage replication and other High Availability features, so it is not suitable for hosting production payloads.

## What you will need

1. SSH access to one or more vms (or physical machines) with a minimal install of Rocky8 (Playbooks should work on any RHEL8 based distro). See https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/installation/ for Rocky Linux installation instructions. Your account on the nodes must be able to sudo or be root.
2. Your workstation running a linux OS with Ansible installed. (I have not tried to run the playbooks from a windows or macos PC). You must be able to SSH to your cluster nodes from your workstation. 


## Setting up the cluster

1. Copy your SSH public key to each of your nodes, so ansible can ssh without asking for password:  
   ```ssh-copy-id <node-ip>``` 
2. Git clone this repo (e.g. ```git clone https://github.com/ktogias/rocky8-microk8s.git```)
3. Open your terminal in rocky8-microk8s folder (e.g. ```cd rocky8-microk8s```)
4. Run ansible-host-configuration.sh scrit. This will install the reqired Ansible extensions:  
  ```./ansible-host-configuration.sh```
5. Copy ```hosts.ini.dist``` to ```hosts.ini``` and edit it to match your node machines info:   
   ```cp hosts.ini.dist hosts.ini```  
   The ```[all]``` group has info about all the nodes. Fill the ssh port (ansible_port), the ip (ansible_host) and the username (ansible_user) you use to SSH to your nodes.  
   The ```[init]``` group should conatin the name of the initial node from where you are going to initiate the cluster. It will be a kuberentes master (control plane) for the cluster.  
   The ```[masters]``` group should contain all the nodes that will have a kuberentes master (control plane) role.  
   The ```[workers]``` group should contain all the nodes that will have kuberentes worker role.   
6. Copy ```vars.yaml.dist``` to ```vars.yaml``` and edit it to match your configuration. See file comments for more info.  
   ```cp vars.yaml.dist vars.yaml```  
7. Run the ```hosts_setup``` palybook:  
   ```ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini -e @vars.yaml hosts_setup.yaml -K```  
   This will update the OS, install and configure your nodes' software  
8. If you have more than on node and want them to form one cluster run the ```add_nodes``` playbook:  
   ```ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini -e @vars.yaml add_nodes.yaml -K```  
   This will make each node in the ```[workers]``` group join the cluster initiated on the node in ```[init]``` group.  
   
That's it! Now you have a running Microk8s Kuberentes Cluster!!!  

## Enabling Microk8s utilities
   
To enable basic Microk8s utilities such as ingress, dns, dashboard, storage, registry and helm3 run  ```deploy_utils``` playbook:  
   ```ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini -e @vars.yaml deploy_utils.yaml -K```  
   
To access kuberentes dashboard open your browser to https://```dashboardIngressHost```/dashboard/ (see ```vars.yaml```) and use the token displayed by ```deploy_utils``` playbook.

## Deploying GitLab

Now that you have a kuberentes cluster you are ready to start developing the projects that you will host or test on it.  
Something is missing though. You need a collaboration platform for you and your DevOps team.   
So let's deploy a self hosted [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) instance on our cluster!  

* Please read [GitLab Helm Chart Requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/#requirements).  
If your cluster is too small in terms of CPU cores and RAM for GitLab the deployment will fail.

1. Copy ```gitlab_vars.yaml.dist``` to ```gitlab_vars.yaml``` and edit it to match your configuration. See file comments for more info.  
   ```cp gitlab_vars.yaml.dist gitlab_vars.yaml```  
2. Run the ```deploy_gitlab``` palybook with ```gitlab_vars```:  
   ```ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini -e @gitlab_vars.yaml deploy_gitlab.yaml -K```  

Wait for the deployment to complete (it may take several minutes) and then open your browser to https://gitlab.```domain``` (see ```gitlab_vars.yaml```) and login using the root account and root password (see ```rootPassword``` in ```gitlab_vars.yaml```).  

## Setting up GitLab and pushing your code

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/set_up_organization.html and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/  for setting up and using gitlab.

## Enabling CD pipeline for your project

1. Follow the steps in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/add_existing_cluster.html to connect your Microk8s cluster to your GitLab Deployment through cluster certificates.
   - Prepend any kubectl commands with microk8s. e.g. ```microk8s kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $(microk8s kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep gitlab | awk '{print $1}')```.
   - In step 3.c. if the API url returned has is of the form ```https://127.0.0.1:16443```, substitute ```127.0.0.1``` with the public ip of your init node.
   - You can skip steps e.i. and e.ii. as the required ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding resources have already been created by deploy_gitlab.yaml playbook.  
   - You don't have to disable Role-Based Access Control.
2. Setup for building and pushing container images.  
   You will build and push your container images to your cluster's registry. The registry we use in this setup is the default deployed by Microk8s, that is configured with no encryption (insecure registry).
   - In order to be able to build container images through your GitLab pipelines you can use Kaniko builder (https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko). 
   - gitlab-kaniko (https://gitlab.com/griffinplus/gitlab-kaniko) provides an image with kaniko prepared for use on a Gitlab CI Runner. The current gitlab-kaniko image uses an old kaniko version that fail push to insecure registries. 
   - You can use my gitlab-kaniko fork at https://github.com/ktogias/gitlab-kaniko to build a gitlab-kaniko image with kaniko 1.7.0 that works fine with the insecure regstry of your cluster. Clone the project and run ```docker build .```. Then tag the image as ```<your-cluster's-domain-name>:32000/gitlab-kaniko/kanikov1.14:latest``` and push it to your registry. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/ for pushing and https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/ for setting up pushing to your insecure registry from your workstation. If you are usign podman see https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/manage-container-registries .
3. Create a pipeline for your automaticaly building a new image and deploying it to your cluster when pushing new code.
   You can find an example pipeline with a corresponding deployment manifest at https://github.com/ktogias/gitlab-kaniko/tree/master/example .
4. If everything is OK when you push to gitlab a new pipeline should be started that will build, test and deploy your application. 

## Known issues
1. When having multiple nodes pods may fail with ```Permission denied``` error for PersistentVolumes. Run ```chmod ugo+rwX /var/snap/microk8s/common/default-storage/*``` on each node to fix permissions.
2. When using self-signed certificates Gitlab runner pod is failling with error message: ```Post https://gitlab.<your-host-name>/api/v4/runners: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority```.  Edit ```gitlab-tls-secret``` in ```gitlab``` namespace and copy ```ca.crt``` to ```gitlab.<domain>.crt```
